# GraphicalModels-BayesStat
Project for the course Bayesian Statistics at Politecnico di Milano.

## Main goal
The aim of this project is to develop Bayesian methods for the analysis of multivariate categor-
ical data. In particular, we are interested in inferring dependence relations between categorical
variables, also accounting for possible heterogeneity related to latent clustering structures in the
data.
